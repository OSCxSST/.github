# 🌐 Open Source Club (OSC) @ Scaler School of Technology

Welcome to the official repository of the **Open Source Club (OSC)** — a student-led, technically rigorous, and radically transparent community dedicated to building, maintaining, and contributing to impactful open source software.

---

## 🚀 Who We Are

OSC is not just a club — it's a **builder’s collective**.

We operate on the principle of **Karma over Vision**:  
> Research → Learn → Contribute → Repeat

We write code that matters, ask questions that challenge norms, and help others grow while we do.

## 🛠️ Our Philosophy

- **Ship > Perfection**
- **Build for the community, not your résumé**
- **Teach what you learn**
- **Zero gatekeeping**
- **Decentralized, distributed leadership**

## 🧱 Code of Conduct

We don’t do fluff — we do culture. Everyone contributing to this repo must adhere to the following:

### 🤝 Respect Over Ego
- Critique ideas, not individuals.
- Give feedback clearly; receive it humbly.

### 🔒 Own Your Work
- Commit only when you intend to complete.
- If you can't deliver, **communicate early**. Ghosting is unacceptable.

### 🧰 Don’t Block Others
- Share access, tools, and notes freely.
- If you're stuck, ask early — and document your last working state before stepping back.

### ❌ No Zero-Day Fame Seekers
- Plagiarism = permanent ban.  
- Claim credit only when you contribute. Celebrate your collaborators.

### 🧠 Teach What You Learn
- Document your workflows, explain what you debugged, and make it replicable for others.

---

We build with intention. If you uphold the culture, you’ll grow here.  
If you violate it — **regardless of role or reputation — you’ll be removed.**
