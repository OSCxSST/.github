# 🌐 Open Source Club (OSC) @ Scaler School of Technology

Welcome to the official repository of the **Open Source Club (OSC)** — a student-led, technically rigorous, and radically transparent community dedicated to building, maintaining, and contributing to impactful open source software.

## 🚀 Who We Are

OSC is not just a club — it's a **builder’s collective**.

We operate on the principle of **Karma over Vision**:  
> Research → Learn → Contribute → Repeat

We write code that matters, ask questions that challenge norms, and help others grow while we do.

## 🛠️ Our Philosophy

- **Ship > Perfection**
- **Build for the community, not your résumé**
- **Teach what you learn**
- **Zero gatekeeping**
- **Decentralized, distributed leadership**
