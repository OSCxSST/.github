## 📋 Getting Started

1. **Find an Issue**: Check the issue tab on respective repository for something you'd like to work on. Look for issues labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue` if you're new.

2. **Get It Assigned**: Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on, or reach out to a core member to get it assigned to you.

## 📝 Issue & PR Titles

To keep things organized, we follow a specific format:

- **Issue Titles**: `[PROJ] #<issue-number>: Brief issue description`
- **PR Titles**: `[PROJ] #<issue-number>: Brief PR description`

Replace `PROJ` with the three-letter acronym (take it from the Repository Name itself, acronyms will be at end of Repository name) for the project name, and `#<issue-number>` with the actual issue number. This helps us link PRs directly to issues.

**Example**:
- **Issue**: `[OWU] #42: Add user authentication`
- **PR**: `[OWU] #42: Implement OAuth2 for login`

Always include the issue number in your PR description so that the relevant issue can be automatically closed once the PR is merged.

## 🧩 Creating Issues

When you create a new issue, follow this structure to make it easier for everyone:

1. **Overview**: A brief summary of the issue.
2. **Tasks**: Break down the issue into smaller tasks or steps using bullet points or a checklist (preferred).
3. **Resources/Examples**: Provide any links, screenshots, or code snippets that can help clarify the issue.

This way, anyone picking up the issue has a clear roadmap to follow.

## 🔄 PR Descriptions

For Pull Requests, use a similar structure:

1. **Overview**: Briefly explain what the PR does.
2. **Changes Made**: List out the key changes, ideally linking them to the tasks from the issue.
3. **Testing**: Mention if you've tested the changes and how (e.g., "Tested locally on my machine", "Added unit tests").
4. **Related Issues**: Reference the issue number(s) this PR addresses.

This makes it easy for core members to review and merge PRs efficiently.
